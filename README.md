### Development of cavity and microstrip resonators for electron spin
resonance experiments

Electron spin resonance is used as a spectroscopic tool for studying magnetic systems in
many areas of science. Generally, cavity resonators are used to generate the oscillating
microwave field. There is a necessity for improving the performance of the existing
resonators, as well as designing planar resonators in the X-band region of frequencies.
This thesis work presents a cavity operating in transverse electric mode (TE011) and also
a planar resonator operating at 11 GHz. The cavities showed good results in continuous
EPR spectroscopy. Although proposed microstrip resonators did not perform as good as
the reported designs, an improved design is suggested for the future. Planar resonators
are advantageous in pulsed ESR and these microstrip resonators will be useful in spin-
based quantum information processing.
